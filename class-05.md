### Linked Lists Instruction

Linked lists are made of structures called nodes. These nodes are each a part of the list, and are only aware of their neighbors on the list. Their neighbors being those associated on the list as they can be decentralized in memory storage.  

There are two types of nodes in the list there is the head node and the body nodes. The difference is the head node is the first item in the list and the lists major address. the body nodes are associated with the head node and do not have an easily accessible address.

Unlike a list (array) to locate a node in a linked list the algorithm has to traverse the entire list, versus in a list, just point to an index number.

The two parts of the node are the data it contains and the address of the neighbor node. A node can either have one or two addresses, based on the linked list type. A single linked list only has nodes with one address and a doubly linked list has the addresses of the node before it and after it.

I hope this helps. There are may facets of a linked lists. This is just one part.
