### Getting started with Django ([Article](https://www.djangoproject.com/start/))
- Just the Intro to Django section.

I am excited to learn about Django. The operational use of it has so many possibilities. Django also has template language that is appealing and permits the usability like the rest of python. It also has the ability to directly wire forms from HTML, and possibly React without the intermediary language of JS or others. 

Authentication is another feature that is full featured. I imagine similar to Auth0, perhaps just not as robust. It is going to be an adventure for sure. Learning another SDK for python, we are just getting pommeled with python and its features, I love it.

### How Django Works Behind the Scenes ([Article](https://wsvincent.com/how-django-works-behind-the-scenes/))

I always wondered how open source projects maintained over the years. I knew the volunteer portion was in existence. I was curious if there was ever anyone on the payroll. The answer is a yes. Though part time for the mundane an required items.

It would be interesting to be apart of the organization as a contributor. I wonder how one becomes one. I guess the NFPs are very similar. More reading required.
