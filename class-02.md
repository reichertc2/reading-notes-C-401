### In Tests We Trust - TDD with Python ([Article](https://code.likeagirl.io/in-tests-we-trust-tdd-with-python-af69f47e6932))


Testing is one method that is foreign to me. I look forward to implementing them into my code base. The fact that testing requires you to plan out your application in advance is a major benefit. It definatley prevents scope creep, a PMs worst nightmare. A clients if it costs more money.

### If name equals main ([Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-does-the-if-__name__-__main__-do/))

Modularization of code is something I enjoy. Its brings order to the chaos of one page nightmares. It looks different for now, I will get to know it better with practice.

### Recursion ([Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/recursion/)) || What on Earth is Recursion ([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv9NEXX1VHc))

The recursion is a spacial concept for sure. Multiple variables under the same name. Its sounds confusing. All it is down each level of the recursion, a new variable is created and waiting for the answer of the next level of the recursion.
