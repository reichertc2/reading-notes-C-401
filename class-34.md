I know configuration is vital to any successful setup. It goes to show Django is not different. The idea is to get your project to be as seamless and portable as possible. If the configuration is specific to an environment, it will break in others, possibly.

One best practice is to incorporate a ```.env``` file. Which is smart, otherwise all your relevent info is out for the world to see. 

Another convention is the use of ```django-environ```.  It can be easier to use than the ```os.environ```. 

Another convention is the 12 factors created by Heroku:
- Codebase
- Dependencies
- Config
- Backing Services
- Build, Release, run
- Processes
- Port binding
- Concurrency
- Disposability
- Dev/prod parity
- Logs
- Admin processes
