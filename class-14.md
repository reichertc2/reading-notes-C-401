### Matplotlib Tutorial ([Article](https://github.com/rougier/matplotlib-tutorial))

That is indeed a comprehensive tutorial. I especially like the example chart customization. It is one thing to display information, it is another to have the data understood. I already have a few ideas in implementation on some pet projects. The tutorial includes quite a few tailoring techniques and code base examples. 

I especially like the quick references, most tutorials negate this critical feature.
