### Pain and Suffering ([Article](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-python-guide/curriculum/class-01/notes/pain_suffering))

An interesting choice for the first article to read. I consider it a caution sign. Yes, the pain is coming. As for that it is only a short duration. 10 weeks in the grand scheme of things is not long, but stay focused. The end is closer than you think.

Suffering is the feeling I mostly get, but the pain will rule, because it has purpose. Just like S.E.R.E.

### Beginners Guide to Big O ([Article](https://rob-bell.net/2009/06/a-beginners-guide-to-big-o-notation))

Huh, not sure what to make of this. I guess its one of those read multiple times. In a nutshell, per the article:
* O(1) - executes in the same space
    * 2 = 2
* O(N) - grow linair and in direct proportion to the size of the data set
    * For each to check value of true 1:1 ratio
* O(N^2) - directly proportional to the square of the size of the dataset
    * a double for loop 
* o(2^N) - doubles with every input of data set
    * a Fionacci number
