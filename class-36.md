### Whiteboard Advice ([Article](https://hackernoon.com/the-best-whiteboard-interview-advice-i-ever-received-3ebbfa72e4a))

The major take away from this read is communicate, communicate, communicate. It is better to get a crystal clear picture of the challenge presented in the white board than to present working code for the wrong challenge. 

The next is to be clear, ask about inputs and outputs, test cases needed to be passed, etc. These answers will be instrumental in the correct solution being presented.

Additionally, it is not cheating to ask for help when you get stuck. Ask about resources even go through your trouble shooting process.

Above all, this is a conversation between you and your interviewer(s). Some cases working code is not the end goal, but can be. Build a rapport as much as possible, by verbalizing as much as possible and asking clarifying questions as you go along.

### 6 Tips ([Article](https://medium.com/@steve_45636/6-tips-to-ace-a-whiteboard-programming-interview-f06c1b378bc6))

There are a few repeats from the previous article, but with more clarifying pointers.  For example, communication is heavily emphasized. One point of detail. Is to not communicate for the same of communication. It is ok to pause and reflect on the solution, just communicate that to the interviewer.

Another prop is the writing of psuedocode. It is important to review your logic before syntax, no need to write perfect code if there is a major logic error. 

It is also ok to make references to other languages functionality, especially if your familiar. The example of ```.contains()``` in javascript, when your writing C#. Especially if you know an equivalent exists, you just cannot remember it.

All great points, just need to be familiar with the logic first, then syntax.
