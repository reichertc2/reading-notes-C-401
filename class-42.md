### Dunder Methods ([Article](https://dbader.org/blog/python-dunder-methods))

There is a lot more to them than ```__init__``` and ```__str__```. Iteration can be accomplished with dunder methods. They can also have overloading on comparing accounts. ```__call__``` can also make python obects callable. 

These are just a few of the multitude of dunder methods available to python programmers. i look forward to exploring each in due time.

### Iterators ([Article](https://dbader.org/blog/python-iterators))

Indeed iterators are clean ways of traversing objects, lists, etc. These all include but not limited to ```for``` loops, ```while``` loops, and some others I was not previously aquainted with. Like ```iter``` in combination with ```next```.

### Generators ([Article](https://dbader.org/blog/python-generators))

Still not quite clear on generators. They typically utilized the yeild statement and raise the ```StopIteration``` exceptions. They are typically used as class based iterators for boiler plate code.
