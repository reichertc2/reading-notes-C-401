### Upgrade Your Technical Skills with Deliberate Practice. ([Article](https://web.archive.org/web/20160616225417/http://www.happybearsoftware.com/upgrade-your-technical-skills-with-deliberate-practice))

Definatley an interesting read. It is the truth that the challenge of learning a new skill is the toughest at the beginning. Looking back a few months ago, prior to starting the 101 course. I felt confident in my abilities to get it done. Mostly due to the fact that I had learned HTML a couple of decades prior. 

I was in for a lesson in humility. I never fathomed how much has changed since then. Each course I progressed into has pushed me farther than I even knew existed. It reminds me of when I first learned how to fly. Attempting to hover for the first time in a squirrelly aircraft like the Bell 206 seemed insurmountable. After about 10 hours of near death experiences, I was able to hold a hover, by no means like a pro, but at least I wouldn't kill anyone.

As the years passed the flying became routine and uninspiring. My unit would limit the ability to push the limits and I got bored. I found that programming app, in excel far more mentally stimulating. 

Hence here I am.

### Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset ([Video](https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve?language=en))

An interesting idea. The past methods of accounting for ability are no longer valid. I know the majority of people I interact with outside of the courses do have a limited or fixed mindset. The idea of yet, a simple term I could not place in my studies. I had a distaste for institutional learning for the longest time. The idea of failure as the end of the road is rampant. I know I typically pick things up quicker than most. Perhaps that is why I get bored easily when learning a new task, skill, or ability. 

The idea of yet is one I have recently adopted just prior to taking these courses. I have a mindset that everyone can learn anything they put their mind to. The only difference is how long it takes them to do it. I just find it frustrating that we are only discovering this now as a community in just the past couple of decades. The next generation will be blessed with this insight if it spreads like it needs to.

### Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit ([Video](https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_grit_the_power_of_passion_and_perseverance))

True grit is precious gift. I know over the course of my career, grit is the one thing I do lack. It is the one thing holding me back in many ways. I have had the unfortunate fortune of being able to pick and execute things of varying skill sets with ease. This is and has always been my bane. As I never had the gift of having to grind through failure.

Failure has always been a struggle for me. I did not do well with it, it is something I struggle with today. Over these courses, I have been frustrated, annoyed, and down right mad at my computer for not understanding me. It should have the ability to read my mind and do what I want it to do. Alas, it does not. 

My comfort with failure is still a tenuous relationship. It is one I wish to extend my comfort zone and a lesson I want to teach my family. Failure is ok, its going to take a lot of grit to get there, but in the end it is worth it.

### Alain de Botton on Redefining Success ([Video](https://www.ted.com/talks/alain_de_botton_a_kinder_gentler_philosophy_of_success))

Yet again another idea of challenging the idea of success and failure. Both will always be present, and manipulatble. The takeaway I like and have adopted is the rule of person's success and failure is not rooted in my vision of it, but their own. This idea is radical and for most people I speak with, find this hard to comprehend. The idea that someone else has a different view of success and failure is perplexing. 

I too have suffered from this delusion. Through study and exploration of new ideas have broadened my view, though I still carry suppositions. I often catch myself, sometimes quickly, sometimes weeks later, that I am not the center of the universe and every person has their own views and interpretation of both success and failure.
