### Python Regular Expressions Tutorial ([Article](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/python-regular-expression-tutorial))

I have use regex in past assignments. I'm a fan when it works. It is a handy process that can sort and qualify data. It makes edge casing a lot easier. The alternative being lines upon lines of code to cover all possible variants of a phone number, as an example.

I have used ```re.compile()``` multiple times through out the course. It is nice to have it explained outside of the docs. In short, it compiles the regex pattern into an object for reuse in lieu of a string.

### shutil ([Article](https://pymotw.com/3/shutil/))

In short, shutil reads like a command line interface automation tool. It can print, duplicate, remove files and file-trees. It looks pretty nifty to automate some repetitive tasks in the command line. I would like to see this in action.

There are som pretty neat ideas he presented. Some of which I would have implemented years ago, had I known how to code it. Others, not so much. I look forward to the time when I can implement some of these and even some of my own ideas.
