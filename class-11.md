### What is Jupyter Lab ([Article](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html))

Jupiter Lab is .org and maintains and produces Juypiter Notebooks. The Note books are version of a text editor having some additional functionality. Some functionality is in line code lines, in line markdown lines all in the same document. The difference is the blocks of code have access to a kernal, and the code can be executed, similar to a console. The product also has a built in console.

It seems like a pretty cool tool. Especially if you are learning new functionality or concepts, as you don't have to setup a new project just to test example code. Pretty neat.

### Numpy Tutorial ([Article](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/numpy-tutorial-python/))


NumPy is SDK for python has been in existence for quite a while. It is used extensively for data analysis and machine learning, to mention a couple. It can source information from a multitude of types of files. One format mentioned was the *.csv file type, or semicolon separated lists. Numpy has a multitude of tools to read through and convert them to 2 or 3 dimensional arrays. Additionally, organize and process data base of the users request.

NumPy operates in several values: integers, strings, and float. It also manipulates and reads python objects. This is just a scratch of the information and ability of NumPy. I hope to learn more when I can.
