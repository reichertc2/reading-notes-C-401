### Pandas in 10 ([Article](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html))

This is an information dense article on the common uses of pandas and multiple code outlets. Its a lot to take in. At a minimum it is imported: ```import pandas as pd```.

With pandas you can generate many different things. Anything from object creation to merging data to plotting. These three just scratch the surface. Plotting seems to be the one I'm most interested in. To get that in is ```import matplotlib.pyplot as plt```.

Another favorite tool is the ability to bring in data and to produce data to a desired source like excel. Most of the time via CSV files. Just in case, writing to excel files directly: ```df.to_excel("foo.xlsx", sheet_name="Sheet1")```

I can see why pandas are more useful than excel. It automates a chart like no other. Filtering and customizing data can be tedious in excel. It looks pretty straight forward, assuming you know the commands and information you want to extract.
