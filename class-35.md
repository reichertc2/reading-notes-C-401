### Graphs

Undirected Graphs - edges are undirected or bi-directional
Directed Graphs - every edge is directed

Complete Graphs - all nodes are connected to eachother
Connected Graphs -all nodes are connected with one edge
Disconnected - some nodes may not have edges

Acyclic - a cycle-less graph, traversal may lead to multiple hits on a given node
Cyclic - a cycle graph, traversal only hits nodes once per cycle

Weighted Graphs - numbers(or wieghts) assigned to  its edges
