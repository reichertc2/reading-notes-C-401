### Dunder Methods ([Article](https://dbader.org/blog/python-dunder-methods))

Under under methods are still obscure to me. The article did help me out a bit, but clarity is far from present. I know we were introduced to a few dunder dunder methods of ```__init__```, ```__str__```, and ```__rep__```. These are only scrating the surface.

As referenced in my previous writing the command ```dir()``` will get you a print out of the 'directory' of dunder dunder methods. One of these methods is ```__call__```. In breif it makes an object callable like a regular function. Or ```__add__```, adds two integers together.

Either way, it is a very deep rabbit hole to go down into. I'd like to do so, sometime in the near future.

### Statistics - Probability ([Article](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/basic-statistics-in-python-probability/))

Statistics, an interesting subject. I was always a fan of the movie **Moneyball**. I think it one of the better representations of statistics in cinema.

Back to the topic at had, the major takeaway was the rule of probability. In short it is the ratio of possible outcomes of a given data set. A coin toss was used in the article as an example. The coin toss is expected to be a 1:2 of landing on either face of the coin.

Another takeaway is 3 Sigma. It is a template data set that basically shows the rule of probability in action.  There are outliers which makeup the outer edge of the bell curve. Though as occurences increases the probability doesn't change, but the center/mean of the curve will be more representative of the probabilitly.

In short data can be used to predict or to distort, depending on the manipulator.
