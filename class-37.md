### Tailwind CSS

#### Utility First CSS ([Article](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first))

Reading through it, I need some keyboard time with it to evaluate it.

#### Tailwind in 15 minutes ([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIuAyLZPH0))

Not sure what to make of it, Bootstrap really didn't make sense to me. In line styling of css seems like more clutter and hinders readability. I guess I need a bit more convincing.

### Next.js

#### Learn Next.js ([Article](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app))

At least it looks to be similar setup to React as creating anew app. I wonder how many parallels there are between React and Next.js. Here is also another mention of serverless functions.

#### Why to use Next.js ([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtgbaKBhdkk))

Next.js sounds interesting, the integration of the front and back-end could be interesting. I often wonder if specialization over integration will work. I guess we will find out.
