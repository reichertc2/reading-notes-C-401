### List Comprehensions ([Article](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/list-comprehensions-in-python))

List comprehensions are the one liners for the list (array) in python. A simple syntax from the article is ```digits = [x for x in range(10)]```. Another portion of list comprehension can be used ina for loop. List comprehensions can be used on any type of list be it integers, strings, etc.

A helpful use for list comprehension is parsing a file. An example of this is from the article:

```
# open the file in read-only mode
file = open("dreams.txt", 'r')
poem = [ line for line in file ]

for line in poem:
    print(line)
```

Adding arguments for list comprehension still not too sure on how to do this, I will need to practice this.
