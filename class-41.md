### Next.js - Dynamic Routes ([Article](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/dynamic-routes))

The method of use for the dynamic routing is far simpler than I remember in React, class-based. It is interesting to say in this case to identify posts with IDs similar to Django, but only handled on the front end. I'll have to see it in practice to really understand. Walk throughs are decent, I need fingers to keys for it to take hold.

### Next.js - Deployment ([Article](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/deploying-nextjs-app))

At first, I thought NExt.js could only use Vercel, but thrilled others are available to host. Then I remembered our labs, we can tie it to our own deployed backend. Guess I had mental lapse. Either way, once I get my app to the deployable point i'll get some finger time deploying it.

Until then.
