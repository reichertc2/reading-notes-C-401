### Stacks and Queues Instruction 

To Queue or not to queue. In the very basic sense, a queue is similar to a linked list in construction as there is a .next value and the last node in the queue has a .next value of None or NULL. As with a linked list you can add node to queue by pushing it and remove it by pop. There is a difference as there is a progress relationship with a queue, a linked list doesn't have. FIFO or LIFO or LILO are just some examples.

FIFO is first in first out, this progress is similar to an assembly line the first to get a specific part, is first off the line. As with appending a node to a linked list and removing as well . The .next needs to be changed to represent the additional node to the original queue. 

LIFO is last in first out, this progress is similar to cupboard, the last cup cleaned is placed in the cabinet last relative to the others and will be removed first as it is closest to the front of the cupboard. Of course unless the cupboard has a double door design, but thats another story.

As apposed to a linked list a queue is referred to as a stack. It is similar as it does reference the next node in the queue, but doesn't know the previous node. One can also take a look at the queue to see if it has contents or nodes, or it can look at the top node of the stack. Quite handy if you need a preview.

It will be interesting to see how the queue is applied in everyday use.
