### Encryption, Decryption & Hacking ([Article](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computers-and-internet/xcae6f4a7ff015e7d:online-data-security/xcae6f4a7ff015e7d:data-encryption-techniques/a/encryption-decryption-and-code-cracking))

The encryption and decryption has always faccinated me. The simple caesar cipher is basic, but to untrained eyes gibberish. A simple explanation of the caesar cipher is the shifting of the alphabet. In the case of 'adam' with a shift of 3 to the left would be 'xaxj'. Super simple. In thought, though translating to code will be another story.

### Ceasar Cipher ([Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher))

Breaking a cipher on the other hand can be done via brute force, a slow method of eliminating options one by one. The caesar cipher is a substitution cipher. Essentially one letter for another. Modern day computers use mathematics to encrypt and decrypt data.
