## Hash Tables are to Code as Food are to Grocery Stores

A hash table is a data structure designed to make searching for data quicker than quick. They are comparatively similar to a grocery store. Each item has an identifier or key and a location on the shelf. If it is not adhered to the item will have to be searched through aisle by aisle, shelf by shelf. A very time consuming endeavor.

The ordering and classification of items in a grocery store are similar to hash tables. Items of similar keys are placed in the same aisle. Even then those items are grouped together based on product type. To take a step back, take a cereal aisle. You want a cereal, its on aisle 4. You walk to aisle 4. Its currently empty. This is an empty key. 

Now as a stocker or hash function, you have a pallet of fruit loops. You are instructed to place the items closest to the entrance, so you stock the Fruit Loops at the beginning of the aisle. The next day or iteration of the hash function, you are given a pallet of Coco Puffs. And repeating the instructions from the previous day, you walk to aisle 4 to discover the Fruit Loops are already closest to the entrance. So, in keeping with the conflict, the in store policy or conflict resolution, is to place it next closest to the entrance. This is done in the code as a linked list in a process called chaining. 

This is repeated as many times each time adding to the linked list. Unless on the third day you are given a pallet of Tomato Soup. Well the soup aisle is Aisle 7. So the process repeats itself, the shelves are empty, you place the Tomato Soup closest to the entrance, or index.
